## gtasks-cli 

Putting together a simple Google Tasks CLI to make it easier to stay in the terminal and to re-familiarize myself with type hinted Python. 

**TODO**:
* Add unit testing for the tasks helper
* Add tab-autocomplete that leverages the tasklists cache

* Add doc explaining how to download/configure a credentials.json file for new users. À la [gcalcli](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli/blob/HEAD/docs/api-auth.md).

**Disclaimer**: I'm making use of AI to speed things up here and there and to help with syntax for unfamiliar libraries. See AGENTS.md for some context.
