## Agent Guidelines

- **Language**: Use Python for all code in this project.
- **Type hints**: Prefer explicit type annotations for:
  - Function and method parameters
  - Return types
  - Class attributes and module-level variables where it improves clarity
- **Style**: Follow standard Python conventions (PEP 8).
  - Keep code readable and maintainable.
  - Prefer placing private and helper methods after init and public methods, when appropriate. 
- **Misc**: Development is occuring in a conda environment called "gtasks", activate the environment before installing anything. Prefer installing packages through conda over pip.
